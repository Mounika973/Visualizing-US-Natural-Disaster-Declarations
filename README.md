# Visualizing-US-Natural-Disaster-Declarations

## 1. Problem Statement

Natural disasters occur frequently across the United States and can cause widespread damage to communities and resources. Understanding historical disaster data is essential for recognizing risk patterns and improving preparedness. This project analyzes U.S. disaster declaration records to study trends, identify vulnerable regions, and examine disaster behavior over time using interactive visual analytics.



## 2. Dataset Description

This project is based on historical disaster declaration data sourced from FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency). The dataset captures detailed information about declared natural disasters across multiple states and years, allowing for geographical and time-based analysis.

### Dataset includes:

* Category of disaster (such as floods, hurricanes, wildfires, storms)
* State-level and regional location details
* Disaster declaration dates
* Incident duration (start and end dates)
* Time attributes including year and month



## 3. KPIs Used

To measure disaster impact and frequency, the following indicators were used in the analysis:

* Total disaster declarations recorded
* Number of disasters reported per state
* Most recurring types of natural disasters
* Annual and monthly disaster distribution
* States with the highest disaster exposure
* Changes in disaster frequency across years



## 4. Dashboard Pages

The interactive Power BI dashboard is divided into the following sections:

* **Overview Dashboard:** Summary of key metrics and overall disaster trends
* **State-wise Analysis:** Visual comparison of disaster counts across states
* **Disaster Type Analysis:** Breakdown of disasters by category
* **Time-based Trends:** Yearly and monthly analysis of disaster occurrences



## 5. Key Insights

* Disaster declarations are concentrated in a limited number of states
* Flood-related events and storms are among the most commonly declared disasters
* An upward trend in disaster declarations is observed in recent years
* Seasonal trends indicate increased disaster activity during certain periods of the year



## 6. Recommendations

* Strengthen disaster management strategies in states with higher risk levels
* Enhance preparedness efforts during seasons with increased disaster activity
* Distribute resources based on historical disaster patterns
* Incorporate predictive modeling to support future disaster response planning



## 7. Tools Used

* **Power BI** – Creation of interactive dashboards and visual reports
* **Excel / CSV** – Data storage and preliminary analysis
* **Power Query** – Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation
* **GitHub** – Repository management and project documentation
